###### My favorite place is New York

It was my dream to visit there, tourism in New York City is at its peak. Many visitors come there for the sake of witnessing the beautiful scenes and sights.<br> The places  include the Empire State Building, Ellis Island, **Times Square**, Statue of Liberty, **Niagara falls**.
